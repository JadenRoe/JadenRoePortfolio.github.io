                <p>As a current IT student, my educational journey is shaped by my passion for technology, the internet, and structuring code/algorithms. I started college in 2022 and am expected to graduate by 2026.  My current experiences in the field would include being proficient in Java and Python coding languages which improved throughout my semesters.  As of right now I am currently expanding my skillset by learning more into HTML and CSS to understand both back-end and front-end development. A major turning point in my journey was realizing the importance of time management and applying it. Having a balance between my academic pursuits and my personal development is important for me as both aid in my growth and creativity of new ideas and concepts that I would want to pursue and express.</p>

                <p>My professional experience involves coding as I am still developing and building it up. I have worked on different coding projects that have improved my skills in Java and Python, respectively. One involved a project that conducts a timing experiment between bubble and selection sort algorithms to see the performance difference in nanoseconds. Then another one involved A program that makes a worker class that allows you to store different information about a worker from their name, how many hours worked and more which can be changed if needed. There is also an option the hourly and overtime salaries of the workers can be set to see their total pay that is due to them. Other experiences and skills that I have a good understanding of are the Windows OS and PC hardware in general. I can understand file management of windows and troubleshoot various issues software issue from different programs or on windows directly. I strive for more understanding with IT concepts that I am unfamiliar with since it brings excitement to my life. I want to take the cultivation of everything that I learned in the field and bring innovation and evolution.</p>

                <p>Looking to the future, some plans and goals that I have are to diversify my skill set. Learning and mastering Ruby through a program would help open my coding options and experience with potential progress that I would make using the coding language. I also aim to improve my communication skills and gain hands-on experience in IT environments through connections or through internships. My plan for growth includes seeking mentorship, participating in online courses, and consistently challenging myself with new learning opportunities. Then for me personally keeping a positive outlook on life and being open to opportunities is important to me. Having passion and believing in myself will take me to the places that I want to be and envision.</p>
